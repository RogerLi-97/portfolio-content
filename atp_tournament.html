            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>
              Federer has won the third most Grand Slam tournament titles (20),
              trailing Novak Djokovic (21) and Rafael Nadal (22). He is the
              first men's singles player to have reached ten consecutive Grand
              Slam tournament finals and a total of 31 Grand Slam finals. He has
              earned a men's doubles gold medal, and a men's singles silver
              medal at the Olympics in 2008 and 2012, respectively. He has spent
              the second-most time at the top of the ATP rankings (310 weeks).
              He also holds the record for the most titles (6) at the year-end
              championships, where only the year-end eight highest-ranked
              players participate. Federer was ranked among the top eight
              players in the world continuously for 14 years and two weeks —
              from 14 October 2002 until 31 October 2016, when injuries forced
              him to skip much of the 2016 season.<br />
              Federer has won the ATP Player of the Year five times (2004-07,
              2009), and has been named the ITF World Champion five times
              (2004-07, 2009). He has won the ATP Fans' Favourite award a record
              18 times consecutively (2003-20), and the Stefan Edberg
              Sportsmanship Award (voted for by the players) a record 13 times
              (2004-09, 2011-17) — both indicative of respect and popularity. He
              also won the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year Award twice
              (2006, 2013), the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award five
              times (2005-08, 2018), and the Laureus World Comeback of the Year
              award once, following his 2017 comeback season.<br />
              Federer is one of the founders, via his management company TEAM8,
              of the Laver Cup; the annual team tennis tournament which pits
              Europe against the rest of the world. He co-founded the tournament
              in honor of tennis legend Rod Laver and the inaugural edition was
              played in 2017.
