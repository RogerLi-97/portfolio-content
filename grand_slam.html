              Roger Federer defeated Mark Philippoussis in the final, 7-6(7-5),
              6-2, 7-6(7-3) to win the gentlemen's singles tennis title at the
              2003 Wimbledon Championships. It was his first major title, the
              first of a record eight gentlemen's singles titles at Wimbledon,
              and the first of 20 major men's singles titles overall.

              Roger Federer defeated Robin Söderling in the final, 6-1,
              7-6(7-1), 6-4 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2009
              French Open. It was his first and his only French Open title and
              14th major title overall, completing the career Grand Slam and
              equaling Pete Sampras' then-record of men's singles major titles.
              It was Federer's fourth consecutive French Open final, having lost
              the previous three to Rafael Nadal. Söderling became the first
              Scandinavian major finalist since Thomas Johansson at the 2002
              Australian Open.

              Roger Federer defeated Andy Roddick in the final, 5-7, 7-6(8-6),
              7-6(7-5), 3-6, 16-14 to win the gentlemen's singles tennis title
              at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships. It was his sixth Wimbledon
              title and record-breaking 15th major title overall, passing Pete
              Sampras' all-time record. It was the longest men's singles major
              final (in terms of games played) in history with 77 games,
              breaking the record of 71 games set at the 1927 Australian Open.
              The match also had the longest fifth set (16-14) in a major men's
              singles final, surpassing the 11-9 fifth set in the 1927 French
              Open final. The match took 4 hours and 17 minutes to complete, and
              the fifth set alone lasted 95 minutes. It was a repeat of the 2004
              and 2005 finals, where Federer also beat Roddick to win the title.
              This was Federer's 11th grass-court title, surpassing the previous
              record held by Sampras (10). Notably, Roddick lost despite only
              having his serve broken once, in the last game of the match. By
              winning the title, Federer regained the world No. 1 singles
              ranking.

              The 2017 Australian Open Men's Singles final was the championship
              tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2017
              Australian Open. It was contested between Roger Federer and Rafael
              Nadal, ranked 17th and 9th in the world respectively. It was their
              record ninth meeting in a Grand Slam final in their rivalry, and
              their first meeting in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French
              Open. In a rematch of the 2009 Australian Open final, which Nadal
              won in five sets, Federer won the duel in five sets, beating Nadal
              for the first time in a Grand Slam since the 2007 Wimbledon final.
              He also trailed Nadal 3-1 in the final set but won five games in a
              row to win the title. This ended a six-match losing streak against
              Nadal in Grand Slam events. Having lost their previous three
              encounters, this was the first time Federer defeated Nadal at the
              Australian Open and also marked Federer's first Grand Slam victory
              over Nadal outside the grass courts of Wimbledon. Federer extended
              his record of Grand Slam singles titles to 18.
