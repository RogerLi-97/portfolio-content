          <h2>Grand Slam Achievements</h2>
          <p>
            Federer has won the third most Grand Slam tournaments of any male
            player in tennis history (20), behind Djokovic (21) and Nadal (22).
            He has reached 2nd most finals (31), record most semifinals (46),
            quarterfinals (58), and fourth rounds (69), and has participated at
            the most tournaments (81). He has won the most matches at these
            tournaments (369). He is the only man to win three tournaments at
            least five times each, and to win two of these tournaments five
            consecutive times. He is one of eight men to win all four Grand Slam
            tournaments. He, along with Ivan Lendl and Novak Djokovic, has the
            most runner-up (11) showing in Grand Slam finals.

          <h2>ATP Masters 1000 Achievements</h2>
          <p>
            Between 2002 and 2019, Roger Federer won 28 ATP Masters 1000 titles,
            lifting the singles trophy at eight different events. His 28
            triumphs trail only Big Three rivals Novak Djokovic (38) and Rafael
            Nadal (36) on the all-time list.<br />
            Federer won 20 Masters 1000 titles on outdoor hard courts —
            including his last eight— as well as six on outdoor clay and two on
            indoor hard courts. He completed the Sunshine Double with
            back-to-back titles in Indian Wells and Miami on three occasions
            (2005-06, 2017) and won at least one title at the prestigious level
            in 13 individual years, compiling a 381-108 match record.<br />
            The Swiss won four Masters 1000 titles in both 2005 and 2006,
            capping off his stellar '06 campaign with another crown at the
            year-end Tennis Masters Cup in addition to three Grand Slams.
            Federer's happiest hunting ground was Cincinnati, where he won seven
            titles.
