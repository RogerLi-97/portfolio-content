          <h2>About Roger</h2>
          <p>
            Roger Federer (born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss former professional
            tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 by the Association of
            Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 310 weeks, including a record 237
            consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. He
            won 103 ATP singles titles, the second most of all time, including
            20 Grand Slam singles titles, a record eight men's singles Wimbledon
            titles, an Open Era record-tying five men's singles US Open titles,
            and a record six year-end championships. <br />
            Federer played during an era where he dominated men's tennis along
            with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic as the Big Three, collectively
            considered by some to be the three most successful male tennis
            players of all time. A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former
            ball boy, Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in
            2003 at age 21.

          <h2>A message from Roger</h2>
          <p>
            To my tennis family and beyond, <br /><br />
            Of all the gifts that tennis has given me over the years, the
            greatest, without a doubt, has been the people I've met along the
            way: my friends, my competitors, and most of all the fans who give
            the sport its life. Today, I want to share some news with all of
            you.
            <br /><br />
            As many of you know, the past three years have presented me with
            challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries. I've worked hard
            to return to full competitive form. But I also know my body's
            capacities and limits, and its message to me lately has been clear.
            I am 41 years old. I have played more than 1500 matches over 24
            years. Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have
            dreamt, and now I must recognize when it is time to end my
            competitive career.
            <br /><br />
            The Laver Cup next week in London will be my final ATP event. I will
            play more tennis in the future, of course, but just not in Grand
            Slams or on the tour. <br /><br />
            This is a bittersweet decision, because I will miss everything the
            tour has given me. But at the same time, there is so much to
            celebrate. I consider myself one of the most fortunate people on
            Earth. I was given a special talent to play tennis, and I did it at
            a level that I never imagined, for much longer than I ever thought
            possible. <br /><br />
            I would like to especially thank my amazing wife Mirka, who has
            lived through every minute with me. She has warmed me up before
            finals, watched countless matches even while over 8-months pregnant,
            and has endured my goofy side on the road with my team for over 20
            years. I also want to thank my four wonderful children for
            supporting me, always eager to explore new places and creating
            wonderful memories along the way. Seeing my family cheering me on
            from the stands is a feeling I will cherish forever. <br /><br />
            I would also like to thank and recognize my loving parents and my
            dear sister, without whom nothing would be possible. A big thank you
            to all my former coaches who always guided me in the right
            directionâ€¦you have been wonderful! And to Swiss Tennis, who believed
            in me as a young player and gave me an ideal start. <br /><br />
            I really want to thank and acknowledge my amazing team, Ivan, Dani,
            Roland, and particularly Seve and Pierre, who have given me the best
            advice and have always been there for me. Also Tony, for creatively
            managing my business for over 17 years. You are all incredible and I
            have loved every minute with you. <br /><br />
            I want to thank my loyal sponsors, who are really like partners to
            me; and the hard-working teams and tournaments on the ATP Tour, who
            consistently welcomed all of us with kindness and hospitality.
            <br /><br />
            I would also like to thank my competitors on the court. I was lucky
            enough to play so many epic matches that I will never forget. We
            battled fairly, with passion and intensity, and I always tried my
            best to respect the history of the game. I feel extremely grateful.
            We pushed each other, and together we took tennis to new levels.
            <br /><br />
            Above all I must offer a special thank you to my unbelievable fans.
            You will never know how much strength and belief you have given me.
            The inspiring feeling of walking into full stadiums and arenas has
            been one of the huge thrills in my life. Without you, those
            successes would have felt lonely, rather than filled with joy and
            energy.
            <br /><br />
            The last 24 years on tour have been an incredible adventure. While
            it sometimes feels like it went by in 24 hours, it has also been so
            deep and magical that it seems as if I've already lived a full
            lifetime. I have had the immense fortune to play in front of you in
            over 40 different countries. I have laughed and cried, felt joy and
            pain, and most of all I have felt incredibly alive. Through my
            travels, I have met many wonderful people who will remain friends
            for life, who consistently took time out of their busy schedules to
            come watch me play and cheer me on around the globe. Thank you.
            <br /><br />
            When my love of tennis started, I was a ball kid in my hometown of
            Basel. I used to watch the players with a sense of wonder. They were
            like giants to me and I began to dream. My dreams led me to work
            harder and I started to believe in myself. Some success brought me
            confidence and I was on my way to the most amazing journey that has
            led to this day. <br /><br />
            So, I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart, to everyone
            around the world who has helped make the dreams of a young Swiss
            ball kid come true. <br /><br />
            Finally, to the game of tennis: I love you and will never leave you.
            <br /><br />
